    // Let's say we have an array - reference
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
team[3]="lex";
    // however what happens when we update that array?
console.log("players",players);
console.log("team",team);
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person={
      name:'East West',
      age: 50
    }
    // and think we make a copy:
const person2 = person;
    person.age = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 = Object.assign({},person,{age:20, number:99});
    console.log('person', person);
    console.log('cap2', cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person}; // chrome目前會出錯
    //console.log(cap3);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
